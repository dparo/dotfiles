# This file is needed to fix sound in the Faster Than Light videogame.
# When using pulseaudio as the audio server, Faster Than Light
# is not able to produce any output for some reason.
# Faster Than Light uses direct ALSA API to produce sounds, this config
# file it reroutes the ALSA calls in the pulseuadio server (I believe, not sure).
#
# This config file seems un-necessary when running pipewire as the audio server,
# as it seems that FTL can produce correct sound regardless if this config file
# is present or not.
